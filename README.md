 <h1>Hi !</h1><br>
 
Welcome to my Express Blog project !

This project arose as an assignment along the curriculum
              provided by
              <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">
                The Odin Project
              </a>
              , where the main interest of the application is to implement
              a REST API to communicate the client (React) and the server
              (Express).

This project taught the basics for building a CRUD application and relational data using MongoDB.

Also, the application employs JWT (JsonWebToken) to provide
              the owner with authentication and to grant operations that
              involve:
            <ul>
              <li>Blog creation</li>
              <li>Editing or deleting Posts</li>
            </ul>
              Each section of this project illustrates how to do the
              following:
            <ul>
              <li>Structure the folders of the application</li>
              <li>Define API controllers and route</li>
              <li>
                The use of Axios to bridge the gap between React and the
                server
              </li>
              <li>Implement JWT to grant stateless authentication</li>
            </ul>
